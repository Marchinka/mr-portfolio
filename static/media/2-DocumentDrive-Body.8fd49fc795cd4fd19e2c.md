### Target Audience

The target audience for this platform includes technical and scientific employees of the Italian energy company (**geologyst**, **reservoir experts**, **drilling specialists**...), working with documents on a daily basis and need a platform that is easy to use and provides the necessary functionality. The platform should be accessible and efficient for individuals who work in 12 professional areas of expertise within the company.


### Team

The team for this project was composed of 
- 1 Scrum master (<span class="u agile">me</span>)
- 2 Solution Architects - *Luca Di Biagio. Fabrizio Zanette. Microsoft*
- 1 Azure cloud expert - *Stefano Campanella. Techedge*
- 1 Senior Dev Lead  - *Francesco Cardin. Techedge*
- 2 UX designers - *Andrea Caporale. Francesco Villa. Microsoft*
- 5 Software developers / heroes - *Emanuele Serrao, Giuseppe Campanella, Davide Ferri, Andrea Pasquali, Stefano Ruga. Techedge.*


### Project Governance

As the Scrum master, I was responsible for facilitating the whole process and ensuring that the team adheres to Agile principles, assisting a team composed both of technical and design profiles. 

- Complete <span class="u agile">Agile Scrum</span> cycle (planning, review, daily, retrospective). 3 week sprints. Daily meetings with the project team and the customer. Product backload management on Azure DevOps. During all agile meetings cross functional elements from all professional profiles of the project were included. Tasks and product backlog items for both developers and designers were included in all plannings.
- <span class="u software">Architectural review board</span>: during our recurrent ARB we evalueted technological solutions and changes on the software solution, ensure the architecture alignement with the system's functional requirements, scalability, security, maintainability, and other relevant non-functional requirements. Our ARB was frequently about microservices bast practices on **Azure AKS** and implementing features based on **Azure Cognitive Search** PaaS service.
- <span class="u design">Design Reviews</span>: our design reviews included our team of UX specialists, developers, and project stakeholders who provided feedback on the design based on established UX design principles, such as usability, accessibility, and visual design. The design review aimed to ensure that the design meets the needs of the target users, is user-friendly, and aligned with the overall product strategy. The board's feedback helped to optimize the design and improve the user experience while iterating both on prototypes and the final product. Among our team members, these meetings helped us to implement correctly **Atomic Design** adopting Microsoft **Fluent UI** design system.

### User research materials

<span style="background: yellow">Present the user research materials, such as surveys, interview transcripts, and persona profiles.</span>

User research script:

General
- How would you describe the software objective in just one phrase?
- Tell me about the last time you used the document platform
- When was it?
- Why did you use it?
- Was it easy/fun/difficult/etc. to use the product?
- Were there any problems?
- What kind of files do you upload on the platform?
- How often do you use the product?
- What devices do you normally use?
- Can you show me the typical user flows you follow in your workday using the product? 

Positive experiences
- Can you describe the last time you had a positive experience with the product?
- What are the current product features you like? 

Problems
- Tell me of a moment you felt frustrated using the application.
- What are the current product features that are not working properly?
- What features are missing?

After performing this kind of research, we recollected all the users responses, iterated over them, and produced the problem statements that will correspond to the first users stories of the project. The “definition of done” we are working on for this kind of user stories will always require an user-validated prototype of the functionality before the developers could start their work.
